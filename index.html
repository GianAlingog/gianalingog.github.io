          Hello, I'm Gian Alingog, and <strong>this</strong> is my story.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          My father observed that my mental capabilities had potential, since I was able to show excellence in mathematics at a very young age - being able to multiply and divide while my classmates were still learning how to count. Aside from that, I exhibited competence in logical reasoning and problem solving as well; evident when I was doing 3rd and 4th grade mathematical word problems at the age of six.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          At the age of twelve, I started teaching myself the basic of programming, starting out with Mobile App Development with Kotlin.

          I was only four years old when my father taught me how to play chess. My growth remained slow and my strength was
          stagnant until I finally got into my school varsity team at ten years old. Although I was steadily getting better, I hit
          a skill ceiling. It all changed when I became fourteen. I kept pushing the limits, constantly playing more games, and
          reading more books. I finally broke the 2000 elo barrier online on lichess last November 2, 2022.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the other hand, when it came to programming, I did a lot of switching as I couldn't decide what I wanted to do with this newly-found talent. After Kotlin, I learned the following (in order): Java, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, and Javascript - not settling between Competitive Programming, Mobile, Desktop, Web, or Game Development. Currently, I'm sticking to web development.

          Yet, my journey doesn't end here. This summer, I plan to join more tournaments - about once per week - to improve my over-the-board and overall skill. I'm currently working on my FIDE rating and title, and I plan to be a much more active chess player once I move to the USCF.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Although I'm currently focusing on improving my web development skills, I might consider taking Mobile Development as well. I also won't cast aside Game Development as a side hobby because I have some ideas that I haven't implemented.
