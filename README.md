I recommend that you view this on a laptop or desktop on full screen as I did not implement adaptability for smaller screens.

This is a simple web portfolio heavily inspired by Dylan Brouwer's (https://www.dylanbrouwer.design/work).
This project was done just to practice my web development skills and not for any personal or monetary gain.
I am in no way claiming that this is my own design, but was edited to fit my needs.
This is only a recreation of the original.

This is a side project that I created on November, 2022.
